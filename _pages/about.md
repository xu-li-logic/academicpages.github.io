PhD student in logic at the computer science department of the University of Luxembourg. I have worked on the following areas of logic:

* Modal logic (deontic logic, epistemic logic, logic for social networks)
* Input/Output Logic
* Formal argumentation

Before joining the University of Luxembourg, I got my Master’s degree in philosophy from Zhejiang University and my Bachelor’s degree in law from South China Normal University.
