  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce and study seven types of semantics for bipolar argumentation frameworks, each extending Dung's interpretation of attack with a distinct interpretation of support. First, we introduce three types of defence-based semantics by adapting the notions of defence. Second, we examine two types of selection-based semantics that select extensions by counting the number of supports. Third, we analyse two types of traditional reduction-based semantics under deductive and necessary interpretations of support. We provide full analysis of twenty-eight bipolar argumentation semantics and ten principles.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a logic of knowledge and belief in a framework in which belief has a standard KD45 characterization and knowledge undergoes the classical tripartite analysis that knowledge is justified true belief, which has a natural link to the studies of logics of evidence and justification. The characterization of knowledge is based on a flexible model that avoids unwanted properties concerned with the problem of logical omniscience. We axiomatize the logic, prove its soundness and completeness, and then extend the logic to a multi-agent setting. We also compare our framework with existing logics of knowledge and belief.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a type of weighted modal logic with explicit weights both in the language and in the models. The framework has its applications in epistemic logic for reasoning about agents' knowledge based on their capability, and in deontic logic for agents' choices based on their deontic capability or utilities. We make use of weighted Kripke models with the weights understood epistemically as a similarity measure between states and deontically as a measure of expected utilities. We present sound and complete axiomatizations for the logics, and discuss variants and possible extensions.},
