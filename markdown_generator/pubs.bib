  abstract = {We introduce a logic of knowledge in a framework in which knowledge is treated as a kind of belief. The framework is based on a standard KD45 characterization of belief, and the characterization of knowledge undergoes the classical tripartite analysis that knowledge is justified true belief, which has a natural link to the studies of logics of evidence and justification. The interpretation of knowledge avoids the unwanted properties of logical omniscience, independent of the choice of the base logic of belief. We axiomatize the logic, prove its soundness and completeness and study the computational complexity results of the model checking and satisfiability problems. We extend the logic to a multi-agent setting and introduce a variant in which belief is characterized in a weaker system to avoid the problem of logical omniscience.},
